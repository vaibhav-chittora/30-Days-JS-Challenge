# JavaScript 30-Day Challenge

## Day 1: Variables and Data Types

This first day of the challenge will introduce you to the fundamentals of variables and data types in JavaScript. Through various activities, you'll gain a solid understanding of how to declare, assign, and manipulate data within your code.

## Tasks/Activities

### Activity 1: Variable Declaration

Here, you'll explore the concept of variable declaration using the `let` keyword.

- **Task 1:** Declare a variable using `let`, assign it a number, and log the value to the console.
- **Task 2:** Declare a variable using `let`, assign it a string, and log the value to the console.

### Activity 2: Constant Declaration

In this activity, you'll learn about constants using the `const` keyword.

- **Task 3:** Declare a variable using `const`, assign it a boolean value, and log the value to the console.

### Activity 3: Data Types

Get familiar with the various data types supported by JavaScript.

- **Task 4:** Create variables of different data types (number, string, boolean, object, array) and log each variable.

### Activity 4: Reassigning Variables

Explore the concept of reassignment and how it affects variables declared with `let`.

- **Task 5:** Declare a variable using `let`, assign it an initial value, reassign a new value, and log both values to the console.

### Activity 5: Understanding `const`

Observe the behavior of `const` variables when attempting reassignment.

- **Task 6:** Try reassigning a variable declared with `const` and observe the error.

## Feature Request

**1. Variable Types Console Log:** Write a script that declares variables of different data types and logs both the value and type of each variable to the console.

**2. Reassignment Demo:** Create a script that demonstrates the difference in behavior between `let` and `const` when reassigning values.

## Achievement

By successfully completing these activities, I achieved the following:

- Proficiency in declaring variables using `let`, `const`, and (optionally) `var`.
- A comprehensive understanding of the different data types available in JavaScript.
- The ability to identify the data type of a variable using the `typeof` operator.
- A grasp of variable reassignment and the immutability of `const` variables.
